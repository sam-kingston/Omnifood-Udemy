Building a fictional website - Omnifood - that delivers healthy homecooked meals to your door for a monthly subscrption.

Im using a course by Jonas Schmedtmann on Udemy to make this page. Once finished I plan to make something similar just using my own project instead on Jonas' food delivery service.

My goal is to improve my HTML/CSS skills with future plans of being a professional web developer.
